 # iHeartMedia - Music Lab - Code Challenge

Create a React application that shows a list of songs with their information and metrics displayed. The app should have at least **2 pages (views)**:
A landing page, and a page to show data coming from an API.

- Everything should be written in JavaScript / Node.

- Fork this repo and share the link when you are finished!

### UI Checklist

- Create a React App using functional based components and hooks. No class based components, please.

- Create 2 views ( pages ) using React Router.

- Create a page that renders a table displaying a list songs coming from the API. Each row is a song, each column is a song attribute. 

- Employ **some** styling but it doesn't have to be much. You can use the styled-components library but do not use any other styling help.

- Allow the user to scroll vertically and horizontally through columns and rows that go off screen.

- Allow the user to sort the order of the song rows by the column values.

- It **does not** need to be mobile responsive.

### API Notes

Store the included JSON file in an S3 bucket and use the AWS SAM CLI with a **node.js** lambda function to serve the frontend with the data.

Authentication is not necessary.

You do not need to deploy or host this anywhere.

SAM CLI instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

## Bonus

Use GraphQL and/or Typescript
